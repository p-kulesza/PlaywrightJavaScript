    "Is it worth choosing a website with CMS?- The most popular answer is: “It depends”. It depends on whether you need a static website that will not be changed too often. The opposite case may be a website that you would like to update from time to time, for example a restaurant, where the menu would be changed every month. In such cases, using CMS yourself will be more profitable than hiring programmers to spend their time, for example, changing the picture of the new menu on the restaurant's website.",

    "Are there websites where I have to use CMS?- There are projects where using CMS is almost required. An online store or blog cannot be created without using CMS, because the whole content management is included in it. Thanks to CMS, in the online store we will have an overview of sales, changes in product data or the shipping status of items. When running a blog, CMS will be useful for creating new articles and moderating comments. This is a more economical solution for long-term operation of the store/blog, as hiring programmers will be more expensive than managing it yourself or by your employees.",
